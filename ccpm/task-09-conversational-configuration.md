# Task: Conversational Configuration and Natural Language Processing

## Description
Enable users to configure data generation scenarios through natural language conversation. Users can describe their data needs in plain English (e.g., "Generate enterprise accounts with complex opportunity pipelines"), and the AI will interpret requirements, map them to Salesforce objects, and automatically configure the wizard settings.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Natural language processing for data generation requests using Claude API
- [ ] Automatic mapping of user descriptions to Salesforce objects and field configurations
- [ ] Interactive clarification system when user intent is ambiguous
- [ ] Integration with chat interface to configure wizard settings through conversation
- [ ] Support for complex scenarios like "100 enterprise accounts with 3-5 contacts each and realistic opportunity pipelines"
- [ ] Wizard state synchronization when configuration changes are made via chat
- [ ] Conversation history that maintains context across multiple exchanges

## Technical Details

### Implementation Approach
- Create `web/server/services/nlp-processor.ts` for natural language interpretation
- Use Claude API structured prompts to extract configuration parameters from user input
- Build action translation system that converts AI understanding into wizard configurations
- Integrate with existing chat interface and wizard state management

### Key Considerations
- **Intent Recognition**: Accurately understand user requests and handle ambiguous language
- **Configuration Mapping**: Reliable translation from natural language to technical parameters
- **User Feedback**: Clear confirmation of what the AI understood and configured
- **Error Handling**: Graceful handling when AI cannot understand or fulfill requests

### Code Locations/Files Affected
- `web/server/services/nlp-processor.ts` (new)
- `web/server/services/action-translator.ts` (new)
- `web/components/ai/ChatInterface.tsx` (extend with configuration actions)
- `web/hooks/useSession.ts` (extend for wizard state updates from chat)
- `web/pages/wizard.tsx` (integrate conversational configuration)

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task 001: Claude API Integration (required for natural language processing)
- [ ] Task 003: AI Chat Interface (provides conversational UI foundation)
- [ ] Understanding of existing wizard state management and configuration flow

## Effort Estimate
- Size: L
- Hours: 24-28 hours
- Parallel: true (can develop alongside smart suggestions)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Natural language processing system implemented with Claude API
- [ ] Action translation system tested with diverse user input scenarios
- [ ] Chat interface enhanced with configuration capabilities
- [ ] Wizard state synchronization verified for all conversation-driven changes
- [ ] User testing demonstrates successful configuration through natural language
- [ ] Error handling and clarification system tested with ambiguous or impossible requests
