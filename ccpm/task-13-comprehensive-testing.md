# Task: Comprehensive Testing and Documentation

## Description
Develop comprehensive testing suite for all AI features and create thorough documentation for users and developers. This includes unit tests, integration tests, user acceptance testing, and complete user guides covering AI-assisted data generation workflows.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Unit test suite covering all AI service components with 90%+ code coverage
- [ ] Integration tests for AI workflows (schema analysis, validation, chat interface, data generation)
- [ ] User acceptance testing with diverse Salesforce org configurations and validation scenarios
- [ ] Performance testing for AI features under load (concurrent users, large datasets, complex schemas)
- [ ] Security testing for AI data handling and API key management
- [ ] User documentation covering all AI features with step-by-step guides and troubleshooting
- [ ] Developer documentation for AI service architecture and extension points
- [ ] Error scenario testing and user guidance for AI service failures

## Technical Details

### Implementation Approach
- Create comprehensive test suite in `web/tests/ai/` covering all AI components
- Build integration test scenarios that exercise complete AI-assisted workflows
- Develop user testing scripts and feedback collection mechanisms
- Create documentation using existing project documentation patterns

### Key Considerations
- **Test Coverage**: Ensure all AI features are thoroughly tested including edge cases and error conditions
- **User Experience**: Documentation should enable users to effectively leverage AI features
- **Maintainability**: Tests should be maintainable and provide clear feedback on failures
- **Performance**: Testing should validate performance requirements under realistic load

### Code Locations/Files Affected
- `web/tests/ai/` (new directory with comprehensive test suite)
- `web/tests/integration/ai-workflows.test.js` (new)
- `README.md` (update with AI feature documentation)
- `web/docs/ai-features.md` (new - comprehensive AI user guide)
- `web/docs/ai-architecture.md` (new - developer documentation)

## Dependencies
- [ ] All previous tasks (001-007) must be substantially complete for comprehensive testing
- [ ] Access to diverse Salesforce org configurations for realistic testing scenarios
- [ ] User testing coordination and feedback collection methodology

## Effort Estimate
- Size: L
- Hours: 24-28 hours
- Parallel: false (requires other features to be complete for integration testing)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Test suite implemented with high coverage and comprehensive scenario testing
- [ ] Integration testing demonstrates all AI workflows function correctly end-to-end
- [ ] User acceptance testing completed with positive feedback on AI feature usability
- [ ] Performance testing validates AI features meet specified benchmarks
- [ ] Security testing confirms no vulnerabilities in AI data handling
- [ ] User documentation completed and tested with real users for clarity and completeness
- [ ] Developer documentation enables future development and maintenance of AI features
