# Epic: AI-Integration

## Overview

Transform the existing Salesforce Sandbox Data Seeder into an AI-powered intelligent system by integrating Claude API for natural language processing, validation rule analysis, and schema-aware data generation. This implementation leverages the existing web interface architecture, extending the current wizard with an AI chat assistant and enhancing the data generation engine with AI-driven validation compliance.

**Key Innovation**: Rather than rebuilding the system, we'll strategically enhance existing components with AI capabilities, creating a seamless hybrid experience where users can choose between traditional wizard flow or AI-assisted generation.

## Architecture Decisions

### 1. Extend Existing Web Architecture
- **Decision**: Build on current Next.js + Express architecture rather than creating separate AI services
- **Rationale**: Leverages existing session management, WebSocket infrastructure, and wizard components
- **Implementation**: Add AI service layer to existing `web/server/` structure

### 2. Claude API as Primary AI Provider
- **Decision**: Use Anthropic's Claude API for all AI operations (NLP, reasoning, validation analysis)
- **Rationale**: Single API reduces complexity, Claude excels at code understanding and structured reasoning
- **Implementation**: Centralized AI service with proper error handling and fallback mechanisms

### 3. Progressive Enhancement Strategy
- **Decision**: AI features enhance existing flows rather than replacing them
- **Rationale**: Users retain familiar interface while gaining AI assistance; fallback when AI unavailable
- **Implementation**: Add AI suggestions to existing wizard steps + new chat interface option

### 4. Local Schema Processing + Remote AI Analysis
- **Decision**: Process Salesforce metadata locally, send anonymized schema summaries to Claude
- **Rationale**: Protects sensitive org data while enabling AI analysis of validation patterns
- **Implementation**: Schema anonymization layer + structured prompts for validation rule analysis

### 5. Real-time Streaming Chat Interface
- **Decision**: Implement streaming chat responses using existing WebSocket infrastructure
- **Rationale**: Leverages current real-time communication system for progress updates
- **Implementation**: Extend current Socket.IO implementation with chat message streaming

## Technical Approach

### Frontend Components

#### AI Chat Interface Component
- **Location**: `web/components/ai/ChatInterface.tsx`
- **Functionality**: Streaming chat UI with message history, typing indicators, suggestion acceptance
- **Integration**: Embeddable in wizard steps or standalone chat panel
- **State Management**: Extends existing session context with chat history

#### AI Suggestion Components
- **Enhanced Wizard Steps**: Add AI suggestion panels to existing Discovery, Selection, Configuration steps
- **Smart Field Suggestions**: Real-time field value recommendations during data preview
- **Validation Warnings**: Pre-generation validation rule compliance checking with explanations

#### Progressive Disclosure UI
- **Wizard Mode**: Traditional step-by-step flow (current behavior)
- **AI-Assisted Mode**: Same wizard with AI suggestions and chat assistance
- **Chat-First Mode**: Natural language interface that configures wizard behind the scenes

### Backend Services

#### AI Service Layer (`web/server/services/ai-service.ts`)
```typescript
class AIService {
  // Claude API integration with retry logic and rate limiting
  async analyzeSchema(schemaData): Promise<SchemaAnalysis>
  async generateFieldSuggestions(objectType, fieldType, context): Promise<FieldSuggestion[]>
  async validateDataPattern(data, validationRules): Promise<ValidationResult>
  async processNaturalLanguageRequest(userInput, sessionContext): Promise<ActionPlan>
}
```

#### Enhanced Schema Discovery (`web/server/services/enhanced-discovery.ts`)
- **Extends**: Current discovery service with validation rule extraction
- **New Capabilities**: Parse validation rules, extract field dependencies, identify constraint patterns
- **AI Integration**: Anonymize and structure schema for Claude analysis

#### Validation Compliance Engine (`web/server/services/validation-engine.ts`)
- **Pre-validation**: Test generated data against known validation patterns
- **Rule Interpretation**: Use AI to understand complex validation rule logic
- **Suggestion Generation**: Recommend field values that satisfy validation constraints

#### Chat Message Router (`web/server/routes/ai-chat.ts`)
- **WebSocket Integration**: Extends existing Socket.IO for real-time chat
- **Context Management**: Maintains conversation context within user sessions
- **Action Translation**: Converts natural language requests to wizard configurations

### Infrastructure

#### API Key Management
- **Environment Variables**: Secure Claude API key storage
- **Usage Tracking**: Monitor API calls and costs per session
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevent API abuse and manage costs

#### Caching Strategy
- **Schema Analysis Cache**: Cache Claude's analysis of validation rules per org
- **Suggestion Cache**: Cache field value suggestions for common field types
- **Session Persistence**: Extend existing session storage with AI interaction history

#### Error Handling & Fallbacks
- **Graceful Degradation**: Fall back to enhanced Faker.js when AI unavailable
- **Retry Logic**: Robust handling of Claude API failures and rate limits
- **User Communication**: Clear explanations when AI assistance is limited

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Foundation (Weeks 1-4)
1. **AI Service Infrastructure**: Claude API integration, authentication, basic chat
2. **Enhanced Schema Discovery**: Validation rule extraction and anonymization
3. **Basic Chat Interface**: Simple chat UI integrated into existing wizard

### Phase 2: Intelligence (Weeks 5-8)
4. **Validation Rule Analysis**: AI-powered validation rule interpretation
5. **Smart Suggestions**: AI-generated field value recommendations
6. **Conversational Configuration**: Natural language wizard configuration

### Phase 3: Enhancement (Weeks 9-12)
7. **Pre-validation Engine**: Test data against validation rules before generation
8. **Advanced Business Context**: Industry-specific and process-aware data generation
9. **Performance Optimization**: Caching, efficient API usage, response optimization

### Risk Mitigation
- **API Dependency**: Implement comprehensive fallback to current generation methods
- **Cost Control**: Usage monitoring, rate limiting, and budget alerts from day 1
- **User Adoption**: Progressive rollout with feature flags for gradual enablement
