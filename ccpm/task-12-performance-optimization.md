# Task: Performance Optimization and Caching Strategy

## Description
Implement comprehensive performance optimizations and intelligent caching strategies to ensure AI-enhanced data generation maintains acceptable performance while minimizing Claude API costs. Focus on efficient API usage, response caching, and optimized data processing workflows.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Intelligent caching system for Claude API responses (schema analysis, validation interpretations, suggestions)
- [ ] API usage optimization with request batching and response streaming
- [ ] Performance monitoring and metrics collection for all AI operations
- [ ] Cost management system with usage tracking and budget alerts
- [ ] Optimization of data generation pipeline to minimize AI processing overhead
- [ ] Response time benchmarks meet or exceed current system performance (< 30s for discovery, < 3s for chat)
- [ ] Graceful performance degradation when AI services are under load

## Technical Details

### Implementation Approach
- Create `web/server/services/ai-cache.ts` for intelligent response caching with TTL management
- Implement request optimization in existing AI service (Task 001) with batching and connection pooling
- Add performance monitoring to all AI operations with detailed metrics collection
- Build cost tracking dashboard integrated into existing web interface

### Key Considerations
- **Cache Strategy**: Balance between performance gains and data freshness, especially for org-specific schema
- **API Efficiency**: Minimize token usage while maintaining response quality and accuracy
- **Monitoring**: Comprehensive metrics without impacting application performance
- **Cost Control**: Proactive cost management to prevent unexpected API charges

### Code Locations/Files Affected
- `web/server/services/ai-cache.ts` (new)
- `web/server/services/ai-service.ts` (optimize existing API usage)
- `web/server/services/performance-monitor.ts` (new)
- `web/components/monitoring/PerformanceDashboard.tsx` (new)
- `web/server/demo-server.js` (integrate performance monitoring)

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task 001: Claude API Integration (base system to optimize)
- [ ] Task 004: Validation Rule Engine (understand caching requirements for validation analysis)
- [ ] Analysis of current system performance baselines and bottlenecks

## Effort Estimate
- Size: M
- Hours: 18-22 hours
- Parallel: true (can optimize alongside other development tasks)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Caching system implemented with configurable TTL and cache invalidation strategies
- [ ] Performance monitoring dashboard shows detailed AI operation metrics
- [ ] API usage optimization demonstrates reduced token consumption without quality loss
- [ ] Cost tracking system provides real-time usage monitoring and budget alerts
- [ ] Performance benchmarking confirms AI features don't degrade existing system speed
- [ ] Load testing validates system performance under high AI usage scenarios
