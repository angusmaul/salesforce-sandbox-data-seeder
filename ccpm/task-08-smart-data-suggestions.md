# Task: Smart Data Suggestions and Context-Aware Generation

## Description
Implement AI-powered field value suggestions that understand business context, field relationships, and industry patterns. Enhance the existing Faker.js data generation with intelligent recommendations based on schema analysis, validation requirements, and user-provided business context.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] AI-powered field value suggestion system using Claude API for business context understanding
- [ ] Integration with wizard steps to show real-time field value recommendations
- [ ] Industry-specific data pattern recognition and generation (finance, healthcare, retail, etc.)
- [ ] Business relationship-aware data generation (realistic Account-Contact-Opportunity chains)
- [ ] User context input system allowing specification of business scenarios
- [ ] Smart default value suggestions based on field names, types, and validation constraints
- [ ] A/B testing framework to measure suggestion acceptance rates

## Technical Details

### Implementation Approach
- Enhance existing data generation in `server/demo-server.js` with AI-powered value suggestions
- Create `web/server/services/suggestion-engine.ts` for intelligent field value recommendations
- Add suggestion UI components to existing wizard steps (Configuration, Preview)
- Build business context analysis using Claude API for scenario-appropriate data

### Key Considerations
- **User Experience**: Suggestions should enhance rather than complicate the current generation flow
- **Performance**: Real-time suggestions without significant UI delays
- **Accuracy**: Suggestions should be relevant and increase user satisfaction
- **Flexibility**: Users must be able to easily accept, modify, or reject AI suggestions

### Code Locations/Files Affected
- `web/server/services/suggestion-engine.ts` (new)
- `web/server/demo-server.js` (enhance field generation with AI suggestions)
- `web/components/wizard/steps/ConfigurationStep.tsx` (add suggestion panels)
- `web/components/wizard/steps/PreviewStep.tsx` (show suggested vs generated data)
- `web/components/ai/SuggestionPanel.tsx` (new)

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task 001: Claude API Integration (required for intelligent suggestions)
- [ ] Task 002: Enhanced Schema Discovery (provides field context for suggestions)
- [ ] Analysis of current Faker.js usage patterns and success rates

## Effort Estimate
- Size: L
- Hours: 26-30 hours
- Parallel: true (can develop alongside validation engine)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Smart suggestion system implemented with Claude API integration
- [ ] UI components created and integrated into existing wizard steps
- [ ] Business context input system tested with various industry scenarios
- [ ] Performance benchmarking shows acceptable response times for real-time suggestions
- [ ] User acceptance testing demonstrates improved data generation satisfaction
- [ ] A/B testing framework implemented to measure suggestion effectiveness
