# Task: Pre-validation Testing and Compliance Verification

## Description
Implement a pre-validation system that tests generated data against Salesforce validation rules before attempting actual data insertion. This prevents validation failures by catching compliance issues early and providing specific guidance for corrections, ensuring near 100% success rates for data insertion.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Pre-validation engine that simulates Salesforce validation rule evaluation locally
- [ ] Detailed compliance reporting showing which records pass/fail specific validation rules
- [ ] Automatic correction suggestions for data that fails pre-validation checks
- [ ] Integration with data generation pipeline to fix issues before Salesforce insertion
- [ ] Performance optimization to handle pre-validation of large datasets (1000+ records)
- [ ] User interface showing validation status with specific rule explanations
- [ ] Fallback mechanism when pre-validation cannot be performed

## Technical Details

### Implementation Approach
- Create `web/server/services/pre-validator.ts` for local validation rule simulation
- Build validation rule expression evaluator for common Salesforce formula patterns
- Integrate with validation engine (Task 004) for rule understanding and compliance checking
- Add validation status reporting to existing execution flow

### Key Considerations
- **Accuracy**: Pre-validation must accurately predict Salesforce validation behavior
- **Performance**: Validation of large datasets should not significantly slow generation
- **Coverage**: Handle most common validation rule patterns, graceful degradation for complex cases
- **User Experience**: Clear feedback about validation status and required corrections

### Code Locations/Files Affected
- `web/server/services/pre-validator.ts` (new)
- `web/server/lib/formula-evaluator.js` (new)
- `web/server/demo-server.js` (integrate pre-validation before data insertion)
- `web/components/wizard/steps/ExecutionStep.tsx` (show validation status)

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task 004: Validation Rule Engine (provides rule understanding and constraint analysis)
- [ ] Analysis of Salesforce validation rule formula patterns and evaluation logic

## Effort Estimate
- Size: L
- Hours: 22-26 hours
- Parallel: true (can develop alongside other enhancement tasks)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Pre-validation system implemented with local rule evaluation
- [ ] Integration testing demonstrates improved insertion success rates (target: 99.5%+)
- [ ] Performance testing with large datasets shows acceptable validation times
- [ ] User interface enhancements provide clear validation feedback
- [ ] Comprehensive testing against diverse validation rule scenarios
- [ ] Error handling implemented for complex validation rules that cannot be pre-evaluated
