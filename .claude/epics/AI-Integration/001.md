# Task: Claude API Integration and Authentication

## Description
Implement the foundational Claude API integration layer that will power all AI features. This includes secure authentication, rate limiting, error handling, and usage tracking. Create a robust AI service that can handle all interactions with Anthropic's Claude API while protecting against failures and managing costs.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Claude API authentication configured with secure API key management
- [ ] AI service class created with all core methods (analyzeSchema, generateSuggestions, processNaturalLanguage)
- [ ] Rate limiting implemented to prevent API abuse and control costs
- [ ] Comprehensive error handling with graceful fallbacks
- [ ] Usage tracking and monitoring for API calls and token consumption
- [ ] Environment configuration for API keys with validation
- [ ] Health check endpoint to verify Claude API connectivity

## Technical Details

### Implementation Approach
- Create `web/server/services/ai-service.ts` as the central AI integration point
- Use Anthropic's official SDK for Claude API communication
- Implement retry logic with exponential backoff for transient failures
- Add request/response logging for debugging and monitoring

### Key Considerations
- **Security**: Never log API keys, secure environment variable handling
- **Cost Management**: Track token usage per session, implement budget warnings
- **Reliability**: Robust error handling with meaningful user messages
- **Performance**: Connection pooling and request optimization

### Code Locations/Files Affected
- `web/server/services/ai-service.ts` (new)
- `web/server/routes/ai-chat.ts` (new)
- `web/.env.example` (update with Claude API key template)
- `web/package.json` (add @anthropic-ai/sdk dependency)

## Dependencies
- [ ] Anthropic Claude API account setup and API key generation
- [ ] Review existing error handling patterns in current codebase
- [ ] Understand current WebSocket architecture for future integration

## Effort Estimate
- Size: M
- Hours: 16-20 hours
- Parallel: false (foundational for all other AI tasks)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Code implemented with full Claude API integration
- [ ] Unit tests written for AI service class covering success and failure scenarios
- [ ] Environment configuration documented in README
- [ ] Error handling tested with simulated API failures
- [ ] Usage tracking verified with test API calls
- [ ] Code reviewed for security and performance best practices
