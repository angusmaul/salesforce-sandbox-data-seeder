# Task: Validation Rule Engine and Compliance Analysis

## Description
Develop an intelligent validation rule engine that uses Claude API to interpret Salesforce validation rules and generate data that complies with business logic constraints. This engine will analyze validation rule formulas, understand field dependencies, and provide recommendations for data generation that ensures high success rates.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Validation rule interpretation engine using Claude API for complex formula analysis
- [ ] Field dependency mapping from validation rule constraints
- [ ] Data compliance checking before generation with specific failure explanations
- [ ] Recommendation engine for field values that satisfy validation requirements
- [ ] Integration with existing data generation pipeline to enhance Faker.js output
- [ ] Performance optimization for organizations with 100+ validation rules
- [ ] Detailed logging of validation analysis decisions for debugging

## Technical Details

### Implementation Approach
- Create `web/server/services/validation-engine.ts` as core validation analysis service
- Use Claude API to interpret complex validation rule formulas and extract business logic
- Build constraint satisfaction system that generates compliant field values
- Integrate with existing data generation pipeline in `server/demo-server.js`

### Key Considerations
- **Rule Complexity**: Some validation rules may reference complex business logic or external data
- **Performance**: Cache validation analysis results and optimize for bulk data generation
- **Accuracy**: Ensure high success rate (99.5%+) for AI-analyzed validation compliance
- **Integration**: Seamlessly enhance existing generation without breaking current functionality

### Code Locations/Files Affected
- `web/server/services/validation-engine.ts` (new)
- `web/server/lib/constraint-solver.js` (new)
- `web/server/demo-server.js` (enhance data generation with validation checks)
- `web/server/services/enhanced-discovery.ts` (integration point for validation rules)

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task 001: Claude API Integration (required for rule interpretation)
- [ ] Task 002: Enhanced Schema Discovery (provides validation rule data)
- [ ] Understanding of current data generation logic and success/failure patterns

## Effort Estimate
- Size: XL
- Hours: 32-36 hours
- Parallel: false (requires both Claude API and schema discovery to be complete)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Validation engine implemented with Claude API integration for rule interpretation
- [ ] Integration testing with real Salesforce orgs showing improved validation success rates
- [ ] Performance testing with complex validation scenarios (nested rules, cross-object constraints)
- [ ] Documentation of validation analysis capabilities and limitations
- [ ] Monitoring and logging implemented for validation engine performance
- [ ] Backward compatibility maintained with existing data generation when validation analysis unavailable
