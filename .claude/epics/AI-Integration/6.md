# Task: AI Chat Interface with Streaming Responses

## Description
Create a modern chat interface component that integrates with the existing web application, providing users with conversational AI assistance for data generation. Implement real-time streaming responses using the existing WebSocket infrastructure and maintain chat context across user sessions.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] React chat interface component with message history and typing indicators
- [ ] Streaming message responses using existing Socket.IO WebSocket infrastructure
- [ ] Chat context preservation across browser sessions using existing session management
- [ ] Integration points in current wizard steps for AI assistance panels
- [ ] Message formatting with support for code blocks, lists, and structured responses
- [ ] User input validation and sanitization for security
- [ ] Chat history export and clearing functionality

## Technical Details

### Implementation Approach
- Create `web/components/ai/ChatInterface.tsx` as main chat component
- Extend existing WebSocket service to handle chat message streaming
- Build on current session management for chat history persistence
- Design component to be embeddable in wizard steps or standalone

### Key Considerations
- **UX Design**: Intuitive chat experience that doesn't overwhelm the current wizard flow
- **Performance**: Efficient message rendering and WebSocket message handling
- **Accessibility**: Screen reader support and keyboard navigation
- **Integration**: Seamless embedding in existing wizard steps without layout disruption

### Code Locations/Files Affected
- `web/components/ai/ChatInterface.tsx` (new)
- `web/components/ai/MessageBubble.tsx` (new)
- `web/hooks/useAIChat.ts` (new)
- `web/server/services/socket.ts` (extend existing)
- `web/pages/wizard.tsx` (integrate chat component)
- `web/styles/globals.css` (add chat styling)

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task 001: Claude API Integration (required for AI responses)
- [ ] Review existing WebSocket implementation and message patterns
- [ ] Study current wizard component architecture for integration points

## Effort Estimate
- Size: M
- Hours: 18-22 hours
- Parallel: true (UI development can proceed alongside backend services)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Chat interface component implemented with full messaging functionality
- [ ] WebSocket integration tested for real-time message streaming
- [ ] Component integration verified in wizard steps
- [ ] Responsive design tested across desktop and tablet devices
- [ ] Accessibility compliance verified (WCAG 2.1 AA)
- [ ] Performance tested with long conversation histories (100+ messages)
