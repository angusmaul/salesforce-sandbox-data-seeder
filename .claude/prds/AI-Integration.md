# PRD: AI-Integration

## Executive Summary

The AI-Integration feature transforms the Salesforce Sandbox Data Seeder from a rule-based data generator into an intelligent system that understands Salesforce schemas, validation rules, and business context. By integrating Claude API and other AI models, the tool will provide smarter data generation that ensures Salesforce compliance, suggests appropriate data patterns, and offers natural language interaction through a web-based chat interface.

**Value Proposition**: Eliminate data generation failures caused by validation rule violations, field constraints, and business logic conflicts while providing intelligent assistance for complex data scenarios through conversational AI.

## Problem Statement

### Current Challenges
1. **Validation Rule Failures**: Generated data often fails Salesforce validation rules, causing insertion errors and reduced success rates
2. **Schema Complexity**: Users struggle to understand complex field relationships, dependencies, and constraints
3. **Business Context Gap**: Current Faker.js generation lacks industry-specific and business-process awareness
4. **Configuration Complexity**: Setting up appropriate data generation for complex Salesforce orgs requires deep platform knowledge
5. **Trial and Error**: Users must manually iterate to find data patterns that pass validation

### Why This Matters Now
- Salesforce validation rules are becoming increasingly complex
- Organizations have unique business logic that generic data generation cannot satisfy
- Development teams need faster, more reliable test data generation
- AI technology now enables understanding of complex schema relationships and validation patterns
